# Real-Time Strategy Plugin for Unreal Engine 5

Open source Real-Time Strategy Plugin for Unreal Engine 5 developed by the original creators of [Hostile Worlds](http://www.indiedb.com/games/hostile-worlds/) for Unreal Engine 3.

We really love the spirit of Unreal 5 moving to open-source, and we'd love to give something back.

Note that we're still in heavy development. Some things are already in place, such as

* Camera Movement & Bounds
* Initial Unit Placement
* Single- and Multi-Unit Selection
* Movement Orders
* Stop Orders
* Attack Orders
* Health, Damage (and Healing), Cooldown, Range
* Victory Conditions
* Projectiles
* Unit Target Acquisition
* Control Groups
* Health Bars
* Minimap
* Teams
* Constructions
* Unit Production/Tech Research
* Resource Gathering
* Fog of War
* AI Players
* Cheats

All of this is already completely working in multiplayer as well, and has been fully exposed to scripting, enabling you to update UI and play animations and sounds.

We're going to add all of this to the Unreal Marketplace for free as well soon (tm).

For a quick look, just open `Source/RTSProject/RTSProject.uproject`,  load `Maps/SKM-DarkSpace.umap` in the editor and hit Play. We recommend taking a closer look at that map (and the rest of the example project) as reference for your own one as well.


## Setup

### Prerequisites

Real-Time Strategy Plugin for Unreal Engine 5 provides plugin content which is usually not backwards-compatible: Content saved with a newer engine version cannot be opened again with an older engine version. Thus, every time a feature or bugfix requires a plugin content update, the plugin does not support older engine versions anymore. The following table summarizes plugin compatibility with engine versions:

| Plugin Version | Supported Engine Versions |
| -------------- | ------------------------- |
| 1.0.0 | 4.24, 4.25 |
| 1.1.0 | 4.25 |
| 1.2.0 | 4.25 |
| Git (master) | 4.27 |
| Git (feature/ue5) | 5.0 |

### Adding The Plugin (Blueprint Project)

1. Close your Unreal Editor.
1. [Download](https://github.com/npruehs/ue4-rts/releases) the latest release.
1. Copy the `RealTimeStrategy` folder to `Plugins` folder next to your `.uproject` file (create if necessary).
1. Start the Unreal Editor.

### Adding The Plugin (C++ Project)

1. Close your Unreal Editor.
1. [Clone](https://github.com/npruehs/ue4-rts) the repository or [download](https://github.com/npruehs/ue4-rts/releases) a release.
1. Copy the `RealTimeStrategy` folder to `Plugins` folder next to your `.uproject` file (create if necessary).
1. Right-click your .uproject file and select Re-generate Visual Studio project files.
1. If you want to create C++ subclasses of the plugin classes, add `"RealTimeStrategy"` to the `PublicDependencyModuleNames` of the `Build.cs` file of your project. Note that you might need to add other dependencies as well, depending on the respective class you want to extend. Take a look at `RealTimeStrategy.Build.cs` of the plugin for a full list of referenced engine modules.
1. Build the resulting solution in Visual Studio.
1. Start the Unreal Editor.
